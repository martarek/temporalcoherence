mathematical computations to produce efï¬cient low-level implementations. In
this paper, we present new features and efï¬ciency improvements to Theano, and
benchmarks demonstrating Theanoâ€™s performance relative to Torch7, a recently
introduced machine learning library, and to RNNLM, a C++ library targeted at
recurrent neural networks.}
